# Personal Post-Class Statement
This respository was created for the University of Minnesota class _Software Engineering I_.  I, Lucas Olsen, worked with 3 other students to create a voting system following common practices in software engineering over the spring 2023 semester.  Apart from this statement, the entirety of this repository is as was submitted.  The grade I recieved in the class was an A, which was largely based on scores for the `SDD`, `SRS`, `Project1`, and `Project2` assigments present in this repository.

# repo-Team7

- `/SDD/` contains the Software Design Document for the Voting System along with related attachments
- `/SRS/` contains the Software Requirements Specification and Usecases writeup for the Voting System
- `/Project2/` contains all of the code and testing relevant to the Voting System implementation using agile.  An additional README is contained within the `/Project2/` directory to explain how to compile and run the code
